# Project: Price Comparison and Analysis for E-commerce Products

Description:
The project aims to provide a price comparison and analysis tool for e-commerce products. It utilizes web scraping techniques with Selenium to extract product prices from different e-commerce websites, such as Flipkart, Amazon, and Croma. The scraped prices are then compared, allowing users to make informed decisions based on the available options.

Features:
1. User Input: The project prompts the user to enter the product they want to search for.
2. Data Extraction: It uses Selenium to automate the browser and extract product prices from Flipkart, Amazon, and Croma.
3. Price Comparison: The extracted prices are compared across the different e-commerce platforms, enabling users to identify the best available deal.
4. Data Presentation: The project displays the product name and prices from each website, allowing users to analyze and compare the offerings easily.
5. User-Friendly Interface: The project provides a simple command-line interface that guides the user through the process and presents the results in a readable format.

Workflow:
1. User Input: The user is prompted to enter the product they want to search for.
2. Scraping Amazon: The program navigates to the Amazon website and performs a search for the product.
   - The search results page is scraped to find the first product's price and name.
3. Scraping Flipkart: The program then moves to the Flipkart website and performs a similar search.
   - The search results page is scraped to find the first product's price and name.
4. Scraping Croma: Finally, the program navigates to the Croma website and performs the search.
   - The search results page is scraped to find the first product's price and name.
5. Data Presentation: The program displays the product name and prices for each e-commerce platform.
6. Price Comparison: Users can analyze and compare the prices across platforms to make an informed decision.
